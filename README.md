# R-Markdown-Project

This is an improved version of the final project of the 'Data & Knowledge' course of the minor in Computer and Data Science presented by me at the Ca'Foscari University of Venice.
The course aimed to build knowledge on the use of statistical methods with R.

In this project I used used some of the most important R packages to make a statistical analysis of the 'Bike Sharing Dataset'. It has been explored with descriptive statistics, regression models and the use of visualisations.
